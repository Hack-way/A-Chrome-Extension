#A Chrome Extension for Text-to-Speech with @hackway

This code creates a Chrome extension that allows users to read selected text aloud. The extension adds a context menu item that, when clicked, sends a message to the extension's background script. The background script then uses the Web Speech API to speak the selected text.

## Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:
1) manifest.json:

This file is the extension's manifest, which provides important information about the extension.
It declares the version, name, and permissions required by the extension.
It specifies the background script (background.js) that runs as a service worker.
It defines the extension's action, including the default popup (popup.html) and icons.

2) popup.html:

This is the HTML file for the extension's popup window.
It contains a title, some text, and serves as the user interface for the extension.

3)popup.css:

This file defines the CSS styling for the popup.html page.

4) popup.js:

This JavaScript code is responsible for populating a dropdown select element (voice-select) with available voices obtained from the Web Speech API.
It fetches the voices when the window loads and adds them as options to the dropdown.

5) background.js:

This script runs as a service worker in the background and performs various tasks.
It creates a context menu item ("Read selected text") that appears when text is selected.
When the context menu item is clicked, it sends a message to the active tab's content script (content.js) to read the selected text aloud.

6) content.js:

This script runs in the context of the web page and listens for messages from the background script.
When it receives a message with the action "readSelectedText", it retrieves the selected text on the page using the window.getSelection() method.
If there is selected text, it creates a SpeechSynthesisUtterance object with the selected text and uses the speechSynthesis.speak() method to speak it.
